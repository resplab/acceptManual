Patients with COPD often experience what is called an acute exacerbation. exacerbation: acute worsening of COPD symptoms; acute means sudden onset, short in duration; COPD symptoms include shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing up mucus, etc. Exacerbation Causes Bacterial Infections Common Viral Infections Air Pollution Cold Weather Interruption of Treatment Exacerbation Severity Mild Moderate Severe Patient has an increased need for medication, but does not need hospital care. Patient has an increased need for medication, and seeks medical assistance. Patient (caregiver) recongizes rapid deterioration in condition, requiring hospitalization. References COPD exacerbations: definitions and classifications Toward a consensus definition for COPD exacerbations 2.2 The Study Population The data for this study was taken from three different studies: MACRO Clinical Trial MACRO Paper STATCOPE Clinical Trial STATCOPE Paper OPTIMAL Clinical Trial OPTIMAL Paper Clinical Trial 1: MACRO Number of Participants: 1142 Type of Study: Clinical Randomized Masking: Triple (Participant, Investigator, Care-Provider) Criteria Age: &gt; 40 years old COPD diagnosis Does not have asthma 10 pack years or more of smoking Study Groups &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Placebo Sugar Pill The placebo group was given a sugar pill capsule to take once every day for 12 months. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Treatment Azithromycin (macrolide antibiotic) The treatment group was given a 250 mg capsule of Azithromycin (macrolide antibiotic) to take once every day for 12 months.

Data Collection: Primary Metric Number of COPD Exacerbations The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of Salmeterol and/or Advair treatment on exacerbation rate. The number of COPD exacerbations during the 12 months of the study is the primary metric. Number of Years: 3 years 2.3 Data Collection: Combined Trials For our study, we combined the results from the three trials described above. Primary Metric Exacerbation Rate The purpose of this study was determine the exacerbation rate of a patient, defined as the # exacerbations / year. We break this down into severe exacerbation rate and overall exacerbation rate. Additionally, we include the results from the MACRO study to predict exacerbation rate with and without the use of Azithromycin as a treatment. Secondary Metrics Exacerbation History FEV1 % Predicted Smoking Status Age (years) Gender (male or female) Oxygen Therapy SGRQ Score BMI LAMAs LABAs ICs Statins Number of exacerbations (severe and mild/moderate) in the last year. Prediction % FEV1 Score. Whether or not a patient currently smokes. 1 = smoker, 0 = non-smoker Patient age at the beginning of the study. For the purpose of this study, we only looked at \"Male\" and \"Female\" genders. Domiciliary Oxygen Therapy: At-home oxygen therapy, used to treat COPD. This metric measures whether or not a patient uses oxygen therapy, 1 = Yes, 0 = No. St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire: This questionnaire is to help doctors/patients determine how much COPD is affecting day-to-day life. The score from the questionnaire is correlated to cough, sputum, and wheezing symptoms. Questionnaire Download SGRQ Overview Body Mass Index: ratio of weight (kg) to height squared (m^2) Long-Acting Muscarinic receptor Antagonists: used for treatment of COPD.

For more information, the PRISM package can be found on GitHub at PRISM on GitHub. 5.1 PRISM API in Excel One of the primary goals of PRISM is making prediction models accessible to a wide range of audiences, including those with less programming experience. The Excel API is targetted towards users who are less familiar with programming, or users who are familiar with programming and would like an easy way to extract the data quickly. To use the model, you will need to have Excel installed on your computer. Currently, the Excel API only works in Windows (PC), although we are working on developing a version for Mac (OS X) as well. Downloading the Spreadsheet To get started, you will need to go to: PRISM Model Repository. In the row that has the ACCEPT model, go to the column labelled Excel Interface and click on the link ACCEPT Excel (PC). This will download the Excel Interface for the ACCEPT model. Setting the Inputs Once you have downloaded the Excel Interface, you can open it in Excel. You will notice there are two sheets, labelled Model and Settings. Click on the Model tab. You will notice several tables. The top two tables are input tables, which means that these are values you can change. For each package, we will provide details on what values are allowed. For example, Gender can be either Male or Female. Plot Options The first table is Plot Options. You may change these if you like, or leave the default values: Calculate confidence interval? Error bar 1 = Yes, 0 = No. Whether or not to calculate the 95% confidence interval Which error bar to show in the graphs (prediction interval or confidence interval) Patient Characteristics The second table applies to the patient. You can use the default patient inputs, or change them: Gender (male or female) Age (years) Smoking Status Oxygen Therapy Statins LAMAs LABAs Inhaled Corticosteroids FEV1 % Predicted BMI SGRQ Score Number of all exacerbations Number of severe exacerbations For the purpose of this study, we looked at \"Male\" and \"Female\" genders. Patient age in years Whether or not a patient currently smokes. Yes = smoker, No = non-smoker Domiciliary Oxygen Therapy: At-home oxygen therapy, used to treat COPD. This metric measures whether or not a patient uses oxygen therapy, Yes or No. Statins: generally used to lower cholesteral in blood, but some studies have recently shown they can be effective in COPD treatment.

["section-appendix1.html", "6 Appendix 1: Installing R 6.1 Step 1: Mirrors 6.2 Mac OS X 6.3 Windows", " 6 Appendix 1: Installing R This is a guide to installing R, geared mainly at beginner audiences. All the information below can be found at https://www.r-project.org/; I’ve just simplified it a bit. 6.1 Step 1: Mirrors When you go the the R home page, you will see a link to download R, which will take you to a list of mirrors. They are organized by country, so click on one that is close to your location. Since our group is based out of Vancouver, I will select one of the mirrors in Canada: SFU Mirror. Once you have clicked on the closest mirror, you will be asked to choose what type of computer you have. 6.2 Mac OS X If you are using a Mac (Apple) computer, click on the link for Mac OS X. You will be redirected to a page that says “R for Mac OS X.” To install R, you want to click on one of the files ending in “.pkg”. If your operating system is fairly up-to-date, scroll to “Latest Release” and click on the file that looks like “R-3.X.Y.pkg,” with X and Y being numbers for the latest release. R should begin downloading, and your Mac package manager will pop up with the rest of the instructions. If your operating system is older, you might want to scroll down to “Legacy Releases,” and download one of those “.pkg” files instead. It should tell you on the page what version your computer should use. 6.3 Windows If you are using Windows, click on the link for Windows. You will be redirected to a page that says “R for Windows.” To install R, click on the link “base,” and on the next page, “Download R 3.X.Y for Windows,” where X and Y are the version numbers for the latest release. R should begin downloading. "]
