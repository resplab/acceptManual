["section-thestudy.html", "2 The Study 2.1 Background 2.2 The Study Population 2.3 Data Collection: Combined Trials", " 2 The Study The accept package and application are based on the paper Development and External Validation of the Acute COPD Exacerbation Prediction Tool (ACCEPT), published in 2019. 2.1 Background Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) affects 300 million people worldwide. Patients with COPD often experience what is called an acute exacerbation. exacerbation: acute worsening of COPD symptoms; acute means sudden onset, short in duration; COPD symptoms include shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing up mucus, etc. Exacerbation Causes Bacterial Infections 3 days ago Fun fact: Mucopurulent and purlent sputum are sputum types containing pus, which turns them a green-yellow color. A study found that 85% of patients with this type of sputum have bacteria in the sputum. Mucoid sputum is sputum without pus, so white in color. Patients with this type of sputum have a 35% chance of bacteria. This means sputum color is a decent test for whether or not to treat with antibiotics (which only work on bacteria). Viral Infections 3 days ago Air Pollution 3 days ago Cold Weather 3 days ago Interruption of Treatment 3 days ago Exacerbation Severity Mild Moderate Severe Patient has an increased need for medication, but does not need hospital care. Patient has an increased need for medication, and seeks medical assistance. Patient (caregiver) recongizes rapid deterioration in condition, requiring hospitalization. References COPD exacerbations: definitions and classifications Toward a consensus definition for COPD exacerbations 2.2 The Study Population The data for this study was taken from three different studies: Macrolide Azithromycin to Prevent Rapid Worsening of Symptoms in COPD (MACRO) Simvastatin for the Prevention of Exacerbations in Moderate-to-Severe COPD ( STATCOPE) Optimal Therapy of COPD to Prevent Exacerbations and Improve Quality of Life (OPTIMAL) Clinical Trial 1: MACRO Number of Participants: 1142 Type of Study: Clinical Randomized Masking: Triple (Participant, Investigator, Care-Provider) Criteria Age: &gt; 40 years old COPD diagnosis Does not have asthma 10 pack years or more of smoking Study Groups Placebo Sugar Pill The placebo group was given a sugar pill capsule to take once every day for 12 months. Treatment Azithromycin (macrolide antibiotic) The treatment group was given a 250 mg capsule of Azithromycin (macrolide antibiotic) to take once every day for 12 months. Data Collection: Primary Metric Number of COPD Exacerbations The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of azithromycin treatment on exacerbation rate. The number of COPD exacerbations during the 12 months of the study is the primary metric. Number of Years: 1 year Clinical Trial 2: STATCOPE Number of Participants: 885 Type of Study: Clinical Randomized Masking: Triple (Participant, Investigator, Care-Provider) Criteria Age: 40 - 80 years old COPD diagnosis Does not have asthma 10 pack years or more of smoking Study Groups Placebo Sugar Pill The placebo group was given a sugar pill capsule to take once every day for 37 months. Treatment Simvastatin The treatment group was given 40 mg of simvastatin to take once every day for 37 months. Data Collection: Primary Metric Rate of COPD Exacerbations The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of azithromycin treatment on exacerbation rate. The number of COPD exacerbations per year during the 37 months of the study is the primary metric. Number of Years: 3 years Clinical Trial 3: OPTIMAL Number of Participants: 432 Type of Study: Clinical Randomized Masking: Double (Participant, Investigator) Criteria Age: &gt; 35 years old COPD diagnosis Does not have asthma 10 pack years or more of smoking at least 1 COPD exacerbation in the last year Study Groups Placebo Sugar Pill The placebo group was given 2 puffs/day from a placebo inhaler for 12 months Treatment 1 Salmeterol Inhaler The treatment group was given 2 puffs/day from a Salmeterol inhaler containing 25 ug/puff of salmeterol for 12 months. Treatment 2 Advair The treatment group was given 2 puffs/day from an Advair inhaler containing 25 ug/puff of salmeterol and 250 ug/puff of fluticasone for 12 months. Data Collection: Primary Metric Number of COPD Exacerbations The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of Salmeterol and/or Advair treatment on exacerbation rate. The number of COPD exacerbations during the 12 months of the study is the primary metric. Number of Years: 3 years 2.3 Data Collection: Combined Trials For our study, we combined the results from the three trials described above. 2.3.1 Primary Metric 2.3.2 Secondary Metrics Exacerbation History FEV1 % Predicted Smoking Status Age (years) Gender (male or female) Oxygen Therapy SGRQ Score BMI LAMAs LABAs ICs Statins Number of exacerbations (severe and mild/moderate) in the last year. Prediction % FEV1 Score. For smoking history, we used the metric pack-years. One pack is 20 cigarettes, and one pack-year is equal to smoking 1 pack/day for 1 year. Number of pack-years = (packs smoked per day) × (years as a smoker) Patient age at the beginning of the study. For the purpose of this study, we only looked at \"Male\" and \"Female\" genders. St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire: This questionnaire is to help doctors/patients determine how much COPD is affecting day-to-day life. The score from the questionnaire is correlated to cough, sputum, and wheezing symptoms. Questionnaire Download SGRQ Overview Body Mass Index: ratio of weight (kg) to height squared (m^2) Long-Acting Muscarinic receptor Antagonists: used for treatment of COPD. This metric asks whether or not a patient has used LAMAs in the past year. Long-Acting β2 Agonists: used for treatment of COPD. This metric asks whether or not a patient has used LABAs in the past year. Inhaled Glucocorticoids: used for treatment of COPD. This metric asks whether or not a patient has used inhaled glucocorticoids in the past year. Statins: generally used to lower cholesteral in blood, but some studies have recently shown they can be effective in COPD treatment. This metric asks whether or not a patient has used statins in the past year. "],

["section-appendix1.html", "5 Appendix 1: Installing R 5.1 Step 1: Mirrors 5.2 Mac OS X 5.3 Windows", " 5 Appendix 1: Installing R This is a guide to installing R, geared mainly at beginner audiences. All the information below can be found at https://www.r-project.org/; I’ve just simplified it a bit. 5.1 Step 1: Mirrors When you go the the R home page, you will see a link to download R, which will take you to a list of mirrors. They are organized by country, so click on one that is close to your location. Since our group is based out of Vancouver, I will select one of the mirrors in Canada: SFU Mirror. Once you have clicked on the closest mirror, you will be asked to choose what type of computer you have. 5.2 Mac OS X If you are using a Mac (Apple) computer, click on the link for Mac OS X. You will be redirected to a page that says “R for Mac OS X.” To install R, you want to click on one of the files ending in “.pkg”. If your operating system is fairly up-to-date, scroll to “Latest Release” and click on the file that looks like “R-3.X.Y.pkg,” with X and Y being numbers for the latest release. R should begin downloading, and your Mac package manager will pop up with the rest of the instructions. If your operating system is older, you might want to scroll down to “Legacy Releases,” and download one of those “.pkg” files instead. It should tell you on the page what version your computer should use. 5.3 Windows If you are using Windows, click on the link for Windows. You will be redirected to a page that says “R for Windows.” To install R, click on the link “base,” and on the next page, “Download R 3.X.Y for Windows,” where X and Y are the version numbers for the latest release. R should begin downloading. "]
